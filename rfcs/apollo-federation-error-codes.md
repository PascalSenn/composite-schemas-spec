| 🔴     | ENUM_MISMATCH                               | Subgraph definitions for an enum are now merged by composition.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 🔴     | EXTERNAL_USED_ON_BASE                       | As there is no type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to where a field can be external.                                                                                                                           |
| 🔴     | INTERFACE_FIELD_IMPLEM_TYPE_MISMATCH        | This error was thrown by a validation introduced to avoid running into a known runtime bug. Since Federation v2.3, the underlying runtime bug has been addressed and the validation/limitation was no longer necessary and has been removed. |
| 🔴     | KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_EXTERNAL                 | Using @external for key fields is now discouraged, unless the field is truly meant to be external.                                                                                                                                           |
| 🔴     | KEY_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE                  | Keys can now use any field from any other subgraph.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 🔴     | KEY_MISSING_ON_BASE                         | Each subgraph is now free to declare a key only if it needs it.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 🔴     | KEY_NOT_SPECIFIED                           | Each subgraph can declare a key independently of any other subgraph.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 🔴     | MULTIPLE_KEYS_ON_EXTENSION                  | Every subgraph can have multiple keys, as necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 🔴     | NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS_MISMATCH | Since Federation v2.1.0, the case this error used to cover is now a warning (with code INCONSISTENT_NON_REPEATABLE_DIRECTIVE_ARGUMENTS) instead of an error.                                                                                 |
| 🔴     | PROVIDES_FIELDS_SELECT_INVALID_TYPE         | @provides can now be used on fields of interface, union, and list types.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 🔴     | PROVIDES_NOT_ON_ENTITY                      | @provides can now be used on any type.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 🔴     | REQUIRES_FIELDS_HAS_ARGS                    | Since Federation v2.1.1, using fields with arguments in a @requires is fully supported.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 🔴     | REQUIRES_FIELDS_MISSING_ON_BASE             | Fields in @requires can now be from any subgraph.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 🔴     | REQUIRES_USED_ON_BASE                       | As there is no type ownership anymore, there is also no particular limitation as to which subgraph can use a @requires.                                                                                                                      |
| 🔴     | RESERVED_FIELD_USED                         | This error was previously not correctly enforced: the service and entities, if present, were overridden; this is still the case.                                                                                                             |
| 🔴     | VALUE_TYPE_NO_ENTITY                        | There is no strong difference between entity and value types in the model (they are just usage patterns), and a type can have keys in one subgraph but not another.                                                                          |
| 🔴     | VALUE_TYPE_UNION_TYPES_MISMATCH             | Subgraph definitions for a union are now merged by composition.                                                                                                                                                                              |
