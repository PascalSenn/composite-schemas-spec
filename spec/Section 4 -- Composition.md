# Schema Composition

The schema composition describes the process of merging multiple source schemas
into a single GraphQL schema, known as the _composite execution schema_, which
is a valid GraphQL schema annotated with execution directives. This composite
execution schema is the output of the schema composition process. The schema
composition process is divided into four major algorithms: **Validate Source
Schema**, **Merge Source Schema**, and **Validate Satisfiability**, which are
run in sequence to produce the composite execution schema.

## Validate Source Schema

#### Output Field Types Mergeable

**Error Code**

OUTPUT_FIELD_TYPES_NOT_MERGEABLE

**Serverity**

ERROR

**Formal Specification**

- Let {typeNames} be the set of all output type names from all source schemas.
- For each {typeName} in {typeNames}
  - Let {types} be the set of all types with the name {typeName} from all source
    schemas.
  - Let {fieldNames} be the set of all field names from all {types}.
  - For each {fieldName} in {fieldNames}
    - Let {fields} be the set of all fields with the name {fieldName} from all
      {types}.
    - {FieldsAreMergeable(fields)} must be true.

FieldsAreMergeable(fields):

- Given each pair of members {fieldA} and {fieldB} in {fields}:
  - Let {typeA} be the type of {fieldA}
  - Let {typeB} be the type of {fieldB}
  - {SameOutputTypeShape(typeA, typeB)} must be true.

**Explanatory Text**

Fields on objects or interfaces that have the same name are considered
semantically equivalent and mergeable when they have a mergeable field type.

Fields with the same type are mergeable.

```graphql example
type User {
  birthdate: String
}

type User {
  birthdate: String
}
```

Fields with different nullability are mergeable, resulting in a merged field
with a nullable type.

```graphql example
type User {
  birthdate: String!
}

type User {
  birthdate: String
}
```

```graphql example
type User {
  tags: [String!]
}

type User {
  tags: [String]!
}

type User {
  tags: [String]
}
```

Fields are not mergeable if the named types are different in kind or name.

```graphql counter-example
type User {
  birthdate: String!
}

type User {
  birthdate: DateTime!
}
```

```graphql counter-example
type User {
  tags: [Tag]
}

type Tag {
  value: String
}

type User {
  tags: [Tag]
}

scalar Tag
```
